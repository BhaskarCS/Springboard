# Capstone 1: Home Loan Credibility Assessment
----------------------
* Build a model from financial data to predict the likelihood that an applicant will experience difficulty in repaying their loans
* The data is obtained from Kaggle and Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC scores are used for model evaluation
* Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boost Regressor, Decision Tree, and Light Gradient Boosting models are compared 
* Light Gradient Boosting achieves best accuracy score
