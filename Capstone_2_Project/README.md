# Capstone Project 2: New York City Taxi Fare Prediction

In this project, we predict the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City, given the pickup and dropoff locations. The price estimation based on the distance between the pickup and dropoff locations results in an RMSE of $5-$8. The proposed Machine Learning model should obtain better results than the price estimation based on the distance between two points.
