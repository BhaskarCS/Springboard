# Springboard

I have presented all code, data, and files related to my work in the Springboard Data Science Career Track in this repository.

## Table of contents 

# Capstone 1
----------------------
## [Home Loan Credibility Assessment](https://github.com/BhaskarCS/Springboard/tree/master/Capstone_1_Project/Reports)

* Build a model from financial data to predict the likelihood that an applicant will experience difficulty in repaying their loans
* The data is obtained from Kaggle and Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC scores are used for model evaluation
* Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boost Regressor, Decision Tree, and Light Gradient Boosting models are compared 
* Light Gradient Boosting achieves best accuracy score

# Capstone 2
-----------------------
## [New York City taxi fare prediction](https://github.com/BhaskarCS/Springboard/tree/master/Capstone_2_Project)

* Build a model to predict the fare amount for a taxi ride in New York City, given the pickup and dropoff locations
* Data used from Kaggle and root-mean-square error and mean absolute percentage error is used for model evaluation
* We have evaluated Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Light Gradient Boosting models
* Light Gradient Boosting performs best closely followed by the Random Forest model
